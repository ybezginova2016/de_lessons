-- Here's the query to replace missing values in the payment_amount field with 0:

SELECT COALESCE(payment_amount, 0) AS payment_amount
FROM user_payment_log;

-- The COALESCE function returns the first non-null expression in the list. In this case, 
-- if payment_amount is not null, it will be returned as is. If it is null,
-- the value 0 will be returned instead. This way, the missing values in the
-- payment_amount field will be replaced with 0, while the rest of the data will remain unchanged.
